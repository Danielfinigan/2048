# 2048
A homemade version of the Popular 2048 Game, this is themed from the Legend of Zelda Game Series,
I do not own any of the images or sound tracks used in this game
This game uses a 2 dimensional array to keep track of the tile objects as oppose to the other popular Unity technique to use UI objects that turn on and off.  I wanted to use a technique that involved more coding then Unity UI settings that could change in the next update.
